# Intro to Ruby (and a bit of OOP)

We're going to jump right in, assuming that you've got a basic grasp of the language. That is to say that you're comfortable reading this (clean) language, not yet in writing complex programs with it yet.

This class will deal with the basic features of Ruby and how it's different from Javascript. There will be a breakout later today that will deal exclusively with the OOP aspects of Ruby.

## Topics

* How they are different Technically
  * OOP vs. (mostly) functional (intro)
  * Methods & blocks vs. functions & callbacks
  * Concurrency Model
    * I/O blocking and general lack of callbacks
  * Scoping
    * Block-scoping vs. function scoping
  * Constants and Namespacing

  * Dynamic typing / Duck typing
  * Everything can be changed during runtime
  * Ruby gems vs. npm packages (a.k.a. There's a gem for thatâ„¢)

  * Optional, required, and recommended things in the syntax
    * Way less punctuation!
  * Common data structures and their methods
