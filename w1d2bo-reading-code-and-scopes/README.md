Reading Code and Scopes in JS
=============================

## How to read code

In this breakout we'll practice reading and evaluating pre-written code in our
head. Developers don't read code top to bottom, and instead in some ways try to
mimic the computer.

## Scopes

What is a scope? Where does it come from? What do they eat?

* Scopes and how they work through Functions.
  * The best way to think of it is that functions are like glass boxes mirrored on the outside. **Everyone can see variables declared outside of functions, but nobody on the outside can see variables declared within functions.**
* "The scope chain" and being able to identify different levels of scopes in JavaScript.
  * Functions can be nested, same variable rules apply.

## Functions as values

Functions can be passed around like data. We'll go over how and why this is important.

## Make sure to read the code!

Most of the important information is there - look inside the [`/code`](code) folder.
