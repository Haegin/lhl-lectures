# Final project kickoff

First some administrative stuff! Before you start you will need to supply the following:

* Team Members
* Project Description
* Tech stack (and short reason why)
* Project Name
* Preferences for mentor (if any)

## Picking a project

There are many reasons for picking a project:

* Are you trying to build something impressive for prospective employers?
* Are you trying to explore a technology?
* Are you trying to practice your existing set of skills?

Think about this, since it will set the tone for what you'll do.

Aside from this, everything discussed on the [midterm project kickoff](../w4d3-project-planning) is still valid, but with a bit more time to work on it!
