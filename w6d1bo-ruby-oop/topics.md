# Ruby and OOP

The goal of this breakout is to introduce OOP (Object Oriented Programming) in Ruby.

We'll' attempt to model a real life example which discuss the following concepts:

* What's a class? When do we use classes?
* What's the difference between a class and an object?
* What does the `initialize` method do?
* What are instance variables and how are they used?
* What are attribute accessors and readers?
* What are instance methods and how are they used?
* What are class methods & variables? What's the difference between them and instance methods & variables?
* Inheritance in Ruby classes
