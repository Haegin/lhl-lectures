# Thinking outside the box - sensors, websockets, audio and other cool stuff for fun and profit.

The original idea was to create an application using accelerometers, websockets and web audio all together, but your beloved teacher ran into problems getting all of this to work together, since we'd need a secure connection.

Not to worry! We've still discussed what went wrong and took a look at several technologies that may see hard to use, but are actually really easy.
